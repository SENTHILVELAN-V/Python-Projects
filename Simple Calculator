Here’s another simple project for beginners:

---

### * Simple Calculator*
*Description:* A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

---

#### *Features:*
- Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Take input from the user for two numbers and the desired operation.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., dividing by zero).
- Optionally, allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

---

#### *Code Example:*

python
def calculator():
    print("Welcome to the Simple Calculator!")
    print("Choose an operation: +, -, *, /")
    
    while True:
        # Get operation input
        operation = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /) or 'exit' to quit: ")

        if operation == "exit":
            print("Thank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!")
            break

        if operation not in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]:
            print("Invalid operation. Please try again.")
            continue

        try:
            # Get numbers from the user
            num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

            # Perform the operation
            if operation == "+":
                result = num1 + num2
            elif operation == "-":
                result = num1 - num2
            elif operation == "*":
                result = num1 * num2
            elif operation == "/":
                if num2 == 0:
                    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed!")
                    continue
                result = num1 / num2

            # Display the result
            print(f"The result of {num1} {operation} {num2} is: {result}")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter numeric values.")

# Run the calculator
calculator()


---

#### *How It Works:*
1. Users choose an operation or type exit to quit.
2. The program asks for two numbers.
3. It performs the operation and displays the result.
4. The loop continues until the user decides to exit.

---

#### *What You'll Learn:*
- Using loops (while)
- Handling user input
- Arithmetic operations
- Exception handling (try-except)
- Conditional logic (if-elif-else)
